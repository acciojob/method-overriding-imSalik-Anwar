Assignment to understand the concept of method overriding in Java.

STEPS:

/**
 * Method Overriding
 *
 * Task 1:
 * create a class com.driver.Main.A, with a method named meth having returning a string
 * "Invoking method from class com.driver.Main.A"
 *
 * Task 2:
 * create a class com.driver.Main.B which extends class com.driver.Main.A
 *
 * Task 3:
 * create object of class com.driver.Main.B and call method `meth` of class com.driver.Main.A with it
 *
 * Task 4:
 * Now override methode `meth` of class com.driver.Main.A in class com.driver.Main.B, which returns the following string
 * "Method is overridden in Extendend class com.driver.Main.B"
 *
 * Task 5:
 * call this overridden method from obj of class com.driver.Main.B
